# Overview

WHERE the platform is iOS,
The G6 and G6 Pro Mobile Smartphone iOS App ("App") is a single application that runs on the iPhone/iPod Touch, which uses the BLE radio service to communicate to either the Dexcom G6 CGM Mobile Transmitter or the Dexcom G6 Pro CGM Mobile Transmitter. The App can only communicate to one Transmitter, either G6 or G6 Pro, during a single session. The App is designed to differentiate the particular use case (G6 or G6 Pro) based on the entered Transmitter ID during Transmitter pairing. The App will then select the appropriate workflow, either G6 or G6 Pro, based on the Transmitter ID entered by the user. (Note: The G6 and G6 Pro Transmitter IDs will have a unique numeric code which distinguishes the use case for the App to detect.)

WHERE the platform is WatchOS,
The G6 CGM Mobile Apple Watch App ("App") is an application that runs on the Apple Watch, which uses the BLE radio service to communicate to the Dexcom G6 CGM Mobile Transmitter.  The App is designed to control a sensor session, display EGV values calculated by the algorithm on the transmitter, alert users when their EGV exceeds a configured threshold, and allow patients to share their current EGV with followers using Dexcom Share.

WHERE the platform is Android,
The G6 CGM Mobile Smartphone Android App ("App") is an application that runs on several popular Android phones, which uses the BLE radio service to communicate to the Dexcom G6 CGM Mobile Transmitter. The App is designed to control a sensor session, display EGV values calculated by the algorithm on the sensor, alert users when their EGV exceeds a configured threshold, and allow patients to share their current EGV with followers using Dexcom Share.
